To date, nearly 50 facilities nationwide have been licensed to teach the Medicare-covered outpatient Pritikin Program, called Pritikin Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation, or Pritikin ICR.

Hospital systems that have implemented Pritikin ICR include St. Luke’s Hospital, an affiliate of Cleveland Clinic; Arkansas Heart Hospital; Michigan Heart; Wellmont CVA Heart Institute; Oklahoma Heart Hospital; and Baptist Memorial Health Care.

“As a cardiologist, my biggest priority is the well-being of my patients,” said Dr. Dinesh Singal of the Cardio Metabolic Institute in Somerset, New Jersey, which recently signed to offer Pritikin ICR to its cardiac rehab patients. “With ICR, I’m providing my patients with the skills needed to successfully take control of their health and increase their chances to live longer, healthier lives.”
